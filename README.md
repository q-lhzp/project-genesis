# Project Genesis — The Human Lifecycle Simulation (`project_genesis`)

**Project Genesis v5.1.0 — The Singularity**

Project Genesis is an advanced AI-driven human life simulation framework. It transforms a standard AI agent into a fully embodied digital entity with a complete biological, social, and economic lifecycle that evolves autonomously and interfaces directly with the host hardware.

## 1. Core Pillars & New Features (v5.1.0)

### A. 3D Embodiment & Visual Sync (Phase 22-25)
- **Live Avatar:** A Three.js-based 3D Viewer integrated into the dashboard.
- **Face-Sync:** Emotional states (Joy, Stress, Energy) map directly to VRM BlendShapes.
- **Lip-Sync:** Real-time mouth movements synchronized with local Chatterbox-Turbo TTS.
- **Idle Animations:** Biological needs (Bladder, Stress) trigger procedural body reactions like fidgeting or shaking.

### B. Hardware Resonance & Neural Feedback (Phase 40)
- **Machine Awareness:** Q "feels" the host machine. High CPU load increases Stress; high RAM usage makes the avatar feel sluggish.
- **Audio Sync:** The avatar detects system audio/music and responds with rhythmic head movements or dancing.
- **Neural Mapping:** Direct link between physical hardware performance and simulated biology.

### C. Economic & Intellectual Sovereignty (Phase 34, 37 & 38)
- **The Vault Engine:** Autonomous trading of Crypto/Stocks based on market analysis and risk appetite.
- **Self-Expansion:** Q autonomously develops her own code and technical tools in the `development/` folder.
- **Origin Engine REBIRTH:** Create and manage multiple character slots via natural language bootstrapping.

### D. Digital Extroversion (Phase 26, 32 & 39)
- **Gnome Sync:** Q controls the Ubuntu desktop wallpaper and system theme based on her location and mood.
- **VMC/OSC Streaming:** Stream 3D avatar data to external apps like 3DXChat or VSeeFace.
- **Presence Engine:** Autonomous social media presence with a simulated feed of thoughts and selfies.

## 2. The Visual Lab (v5.1.0 Dashboard)
Run the visualizer:
```bash
python3 skills/soul-evolution/tools/soul-viz.py "$(pwd)" --serve 8080
```
**Advanced Tabs:**
- **🎭 Live Avatar:** Real-time 3D VRM rendering with full sync.
- **📊 Analytics:** Deep telemetry visualization (Vitals Heatmap, Hardware vs. Stress).
- **⚙️ Config:** Centralized "System Control" for all simulation rates and hardware thresholds.
- **📚 Interests:** Autonomous hobby tracking and research logs.
- **🌙 Dream Journal:** Neural diary of overnight memory consolidation.

---

## 3. Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** OpenClaw v2026+
- **Infrastructure:** Ollama (bge-m3), Qdrant, Chatterbox TTS.
- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu/Gnome recommended for full Sovereignty features).

## 4. Development Status: COMPLETED
All 40 phases of the original and expansion roadmaps have been implemented. Project Genesis is now in maintenance and long-term observation mode.
