# Session Handover: Project Genesis v1.7.0 — Social Standing & Model Optimization
**Date:** Sunday, Feb 22, 2026
**Status:** Multi-Model MAC & Social Reputation Active

## 1. Executive Summary
The project has reached v1.7.0. It now features a sophisticated Social Reputation system and a cost-optimized Multi-Model Cluster architecture. The AI entity now navigates social circles and public perception while the underlying engine uses specialized models for different cognitive tasks.

## 2. New Features (Phase 9 & 10)
- **Phase 10: Social Reputation & Circles:**
    - **Global Reputation:** A score from -100 (Pariah) to +100 (Icon) reflecting general public perception.
    - **Social Circles:** Standing is tracked in specific groups (Professional, Family, Friends, Underground, Public).
    - **Economic Impact:** Pariahs face surcharges in shops (+20%), while Icons receive discounts (-10%). Jobs now have minimum reputation requirements.
    - **Networking Impact:** High reputation attracts higher-quality contacts (Executives, City Officials).
    - **Propagation:** Local standing changes leak into the global score over time (daily sync).
- **Phase 9: Multi-Model Synergy (MAC):**
    - **Lightweight Roles:** Limbic and World Engine roles receive pruned context (JSON only) to run on cheaper models (Haiku/Flash).
    - **Decoupled Persona:** The Persona role no longer processes raw biological data; it reads emotional narratives generated by the Limbic system.
    - **Model Selection:** Users can configure specific AI models for each role via the "Genesis Lab" tab.

## 3. Core Architecture: Multi-Agent Cluster (MAC)
- **Persona ("The Voice"):** Emotion-first interaction.
- **Analyst ("The Brain"):** Strategy, Telemetry & Governance.
- **Limbic ("The Heart"):** Somatic-to-Emotion processing (optimized).
- **World Engine ("The DM"):** Environment & NPC simulation (optimized).
- **Developer ("The Hand"):** Expansion & Tools.

## 4. Implemented Modules
- **World Engine:** 24h real-world sync, weather, seasons.
- **Psychology:** Resilience, Traumas, Joys.
- **Competence:** XP-based skills.
- **Identity Governance:** Profiles, Snapshots, Neural Patching.
- **Reputation:** Global score & Social circles.

## 5. File Registry
- `index.ts`: Main logic, tool registration, MAC injection.
- `skills/soul-evolution/tools/soul-viz.py`: Dashboard v2.7 (Added Social Standing tab).
- `GENESIS_MASTER_PLAN.md`: Full roadmap.
- `memory/reality/reputation.json`: Reputation state.
- `memory/reality/model_config.json`: Model-to-role mapping.

## 6. Next Steps
1. **Refine Skill Boni:** Apply concrete multipliers based on skill levels.
2. **Desktop Sovereignty:** Implement wallpaper/theme automation based on mood/weather.
3. **Legacy Module:** Implement mortality and succession mechanics.
