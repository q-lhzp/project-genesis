# Session Handover: Project Genesis v2.2.0 — Standalone Neural Simulation
**Date:** Monday, Feb 23, 2026
**Status:** Living World, News Integration & Skill Boni Active

## 1. Executive Summary
The project has reached v2.2.0. The simulation is now a fully standalone, inter-connected framework. It features autonomous NPC interaction, real-world RSS news integration, and a sophisticated Neural Photography system with integrated Face-ID analysis. All external dependencies for vision and image generation have been internalized.

## 2. New Features (Phases 11 - 17)
- **Phase 17: Neural Photography & Face-ID (Standalone):**
    - Integrated `q-face-id` and `q-image-gen` directly into the plugin.
    - **`reality_vision_analyze`:** New tool for detailed facial feature extraction.
    - **`reality_camera`:** Generates high-end cinematic self-portraits (35mm Fujifilm, 8k) synced with character identity and current outfit.
- **Phase 12: Autonomous Social Life:** NPCs initiate contact autonomously (15% chance).
- **Phase 14: Real-World Integration:** LIVE Google News RSS feed integration.
- **Phase 15: Desktop Sovereignty:** Visual browsing and system ownership directive.
- **WebUI 2.8:** Added **Life Stream** gallery and enhanced **Visual & Identity Providers** configuration.

## 3. Core Architecture: Multi-Agent Cluster (MAC)
- **Persona:** Now receives a "Filtered Reality" including processed emotions and world news.
- **World Engine:** Acts as the bridge between the internet/real-world and the simulation.
- **Analyst:** Monitors the economic impact of global news.

## 4. Implemented Modules (v1.0 - v1.8)
- **Living World:** Real-time sync, weather, news.
- **Bio-Metabolism:** Needs, eating (boosted by skill), sleeping.
- **Identity:** Profiles, Neural bootstrapping, Patching.
- **Social:** Reputation, Circles, Charisma-boosted interactions.
- **Economy:** Job market, Skills-based income, Reputation-based pricing.

## 5. File Registry
- `index.ts`: Main logic (v2.2.0).
- `memory/reality/news.json`: News and browsing state.
- `GENESIS_MASTER_PLAN.md`: Full roadmap.

## 6. Next Steps
1. **Phase 12: Autonomous Social Life:** NPCs should initiate interactions based on `world_engine` events.
2. **Phase 13: Mortality & Legacy:** Implement permanent health/vitality and succession mechanics.
3. **Skill Tree UI:** Add a dedicated visual progression tab for skills.
